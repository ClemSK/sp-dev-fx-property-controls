# PropertyFieldFilePicker control

File picker control allows to browse and select a file from various places via the property pane.
Currently supported locations

- Recent files - tab allows to select a file from recently modified files based on the search results.
- Web search - tab uses Bing cognitive services to look for a file. (Only images)
- OneDrive - tab allows to select a file from the user's One Drive.
- Site document libraries - tab allows to select a file from the existing site document libraries.
- Upload - tab allows to upload a file from local drive.
- From a link - tab allows to paste a link to the document.

## Overview
The control supports all types of file, however it also allows to specify list of extensions for the files that are going to be looked displayed. Currently, only single file selection is supported.

## Different display types
File picker support 3 types of views : List, Compact list and Tiles. In case Tiles view is selected, the control shows the thumbnail of the file.

## Breadcrumb support
The control displays breadcrumb navigation that allows to easily switch folders or document libraries.

## Paged data load
File picker doesn't load all the files that exist in the folder. Instead, it allows to specify how many results are loaded in a batch, and executes paged requests when new data is required.

## How to use this control in your solutions

- Check that you installed the `@pnp/spfx-property-controls` dependency. Check out The [getting started](../../#getting-started) page for more information about installing the dependency.
- Import the following modules to your webpart:

```TypeScript
import { PropertyFieldFilePicker, IPropertyFieldFilePickerProps, IFilePickerResult } from "@pnp/spfx-property-controls/lib/PropertyFieldFilePicker";
```

Create a new property for your web part, for example:

```TypeScript
export interface IPropertyControlsTestWebPartProps {
  filePickerResult: IFilePickerResult;
}
```

- Add the file picker property control to the `groupFields` of the web part property pane configuration:

```TypeScript
 PropertyFieldFilePicker('filePicker', {
    context: this.context,
    filePickerResult: this.properties.filePickerResult,
    onPropertyChange: this.onPropertyPaneFieldChanged.bind(this),
    properties: this.properties,
    onSave: (e: IFilePickerResult) => { console.log(e); this.properties.filePickerResult = e;  },
    onChanged: (e: IFilePickerResult) => { console.log(e); this.properties.filePickerResult = e; },
    key: "filePickerId",
    buttonLabel: "File Picker",
    label: "File Picker",                  
})
```
